Title: EU27- Turkey Commodity Trade And The J- Curve: New Evidence From Asymmetry Analysis (The Case of Plastics Industry)
Abstract: The J-curve is one of the key theories to determine foreign trade policy of a country. The J-curve phenomenon is based on the logic of concept that devaluation of national currencies makes exports cheaper for foreign and imports expansive for home country. Thus, export increase and import decrease that it make trade balance improve. The effects are not immediate, but are passed on with a lag through exchange rate effects. In our article, we aim to fill a gap in the literature by evaluating the plastics trade between the EU27 and Turkey within the framework of the j-curve concept.

Title: The Relationship Between Inflation, Human Development Index and CO2 in Selected Country Groups
Abstract: UNDP report observes that countries with a high Human Development Index (HDI) are industrialized nations. It is well-known that industrialization leads to high carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. These countries also experience low inflation rates due to their high production volumes. In light of this information, this study aims to empirically investigate the complex relationship between inflation, HDI, and CO2 across different country groups. The study employs panel data analysis over the period from 1994 to 2021, focusing on specific subdivisions within country groups (OECD, G20, EU, developed, high-income, and low-income countries). The results reveal a linear relationship between HDI and CO2 and an inverse relationship between inflation and CO2, providing policy recommendations based on these findings.

Title: Trade Credit Borrowing Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Turkish Publicly Traded Firms
Abstract: This study focuses on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on trade credit borrowing among publicly traded Turkish firms. Changes in the amount and duration of trade credit utilized by firms during the pandemic are investigated using panel data analysis, including Difference Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Fixed Effects Ordinary Least Squares (FE-OLS) methods. The findings reveal a significant increase in both the amount and duration of trade credit obtained from suppliers amidst the pandemic's economic disruptions. This trend is particularly pronounced among high-debt and low-cash firms, suggesting a heightened reliance on trade credit as a financing mechanism.

Title: The Relationship Between Military Expenditures, Unemployment and Economic Growth: An Analysis on Türkiye
Abstract: The aim of this study is to examine the possible short-run and long-run relationships between unemployment, economic growth, military and non-military expenditures in the period covering the 1988-2022 time interval in the case of Turkiye using ARDL cointegration methodology. The limited number of studies on the relationship between military expenditures, economic growth and unemployment reveals the importance of this study. The short and long-run findings indicate that economic growth reduces unemployment while military and non-military expenditures are statistically insignificant. Moreover, the finding on economic growth can be interpreted that Okun's Law is valid both in the short and long run in the Turkish economy.

Title: The Role of Technological Solutions in the Workload and Job Stress of Accounting Professionals
Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of demographic factors and technological solutions on the workload and job stress of accounting professionals. A two-stage approach was adopted: quantitative data was collected in the first stage, followed by in-depth interviews in the second stage. Quantitative results indicate that young and inexperienced accountants experience high job stress, while female accountants have a higher workload. Qualitative results show that technological solutions reduce workload and stress. Legislative changes, the transfer of state workload to accountants, the complexity of tax regulations, and staff shortages increase job stress. Technological solutions facilitate work processes.
